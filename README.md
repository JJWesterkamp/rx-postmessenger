Minimal [RxJS][rxgh] adapter for the [`Window # postMessage`][postmessage] API for request-response streams and notification streams across frame windows.

## In short

An RxPostmessenger class instance establishes one end of a connection between 2 window objects, using the `Window # postMessage` API. Each instance provides methods to initiate outgoing messages and handle incoming messages, both categorized by channel name.

Each instance targets _one single_ `Window` object. It propagates incoming `MessageEvent`s only from that specific window object while it's serving documents from _one single_ origin.

## Usage

```javascript
import RxPostmessenger from 'rx-postmessenger';
```

### Static methods

#### Connecting 2 Window objects

> ```typescript
> RxPostmessenger.connect(otherWindow: Window, origin: string): RxPostmessenger.Messenger
> ```

Both ends of the connection should implement this package. One in a _parent_ project (that implements the iframe), and one in a _child_ project (that's being served by the iframe). Creating a new messenger is straightforward:

_At parent window - `https://parent-project.com`_

```javascript
const childMessenger = RxPostmessenger.connect(
    someIFrame.contentWindow,
    'https://child-project.com'
);
```

_At child window - `https://child-project.com`_

```javascript
const parentMessenger = RxPostmessenger.connect(
    window.parent,
    'https://parent-project.com'
);
```

### `Messenger` Instance methods

#### Sending notifications
> ```typescript
> Messenger.notify<T>(channel: string, payload?: T): void
> ```

The messenger instances give you a way to send notifications to the other `Window` through the `notify()` method. 
The notify method is void -- notifications are fire-and-forget. 
Use [`request()`](#sending-requests) instead if you require data back.
Consider an example where we want to notify a child window of price changes:

```javascript
childMessenger.notify('price-changed', {
    oldPrice: 12.50,
    newPrice: 14.50,
});
```

#### Listening for inbound notifications
> ```typescript
> Messenger.notifications<T = any>(channel: string): Observable<T>
> ```

The child project can request an Observable stream for a certain notification channel. 
In this case we're interested in `'price-changed'` events, but only the ones where the price increased. 
The ability to use RxJS operators can help us out:

```javascript
parentMessenger.notifications('price-changed').pipe(
    filter(({ oldPrice, newPrice }) => newPrice > oldPrice),
    map(({ oldPrice, newPrice }) => newPrice - oldPrice),
).subscribe((increase) => console.log(`Price increased with €${increase}!`));

// > 'Price increased with €2!'
```

#### Sending requests

> ```typescript
> Messenger.request<T = any, U = any>(channel: string, payload?: T): Observable<U>
> ```

RxPostmessenger also supports request - response communication. 
At the requester side a request is initiated by calling the `request()` method with 1 or 2 arguments. 
The first is a request alias (actually just another channel) of our choice.

_A notification-channel and a request-channel can both have the same channel name without any problem._

An observable is returned that emits the response when arrived, and then completes. 
Let's request a greeting from the child window, and tell it to localize the response to `'en'`:

```javascript
const greetingResponse$ = childMessenger.request('greeting', {
    language: 'en',
});
```

We can then subscribe to the greeting response stream.
Provided that the greeting says something nice, we'll log it for everyone to see:

```javascript
greetingResponse$.pipe(
    filter((greeting) => isNiceGreeting(greeting)),
).subscribe(console.log);

// > 'Hi parent!'
```

#### Listening for inbound requests
> ```typescript
> Messenger.requests<T = any, U = any>(channel: string): Observable<RxPostmessenger.Request<T, U>>
> ```

No greeting would ever be received by `parentMessenger` when the child project does not listen 
for requests to handle and respond to. Let's not be rude and create a request stream for 
`'greeting'` requests, and subscribe to it. We'll pass the `RxPostmessenger.Request` objects 
that the subscription receives into a function `handleGreetingRequest()`:

```javascript
parentMessenger
    .requests('greeting')
    .subscribe(handleGreetingRequest);
```

---

### `Request` instance methods

#### Sending request responses

> ```typescript
> RxPostmessenger.Request<T, U> ~ respond(payload: U): void
> ```

The `requests` method returns an observable of `RxPostmessenger.Request` objects. 
They provide a single method `respond` that accepts one argument: the response payload. 
Let's use the method on the requests we give to `handleGreetingRequest`:

```javascript
const handleGreetingRequest = (request) => {

    // The data that was sent along with the request
    const requestPayload = request.payload;

    // A hypothetical greeting translator
    const localizedGreeting = translateGreeting(
        'Hi parent!',
        requestPayload.language
    );

    // Eventually respond to the request with some data (payload)
    request.respond(localizedGreeting);
};
```
