## [Unreleased]

## [3.0.0] (2021-08-17)

### BREAKING CHANGES
- Replaced the `namespace` structure in the TS declaration file with individual type exports. 
- Made RxJS a peer dependency.
  > I'm not entirely sure if this is breaking from a user point-of-view, 
  > but I made this a major release just to be sure.

### Changed
- Added support for RxJS 7.
- Many internal changes: dependencies, test suite, folder/file structure, and more.

## [2.0.1] (2019-06-22)
- Updated all npm dev-dependencies latest versions, fixing vulnerability issues reported by Github.

## [2.0.0] (2019-05-27)
### Changed
- Documented alpha.1 changes in README.

## [2.0.0-alpha.1] (2019-01-06)
### BREAKING CHANGES
- **Removed EventMap feature**

    This proved to be unmaintainable in terms of type-mapping in private implementations
    and also made the package less 'portable'. Payload type constraints are from now on
    enforced directly on Messenger method calls.

- **RxJS v6**

    Upgraded the RxJS dependency from v5 to v6.

- **Removed `Static.useObservable()` and `Static.getObservable()`**

    These methods are obsolete as of RxJS v6, as the Observable operators are no longer
    provided through prototype patching, but explicitly supplied with `Observable.pipe()`.


## [1.0.4] (2019-01-06)
### Added
- ðŸ§ª Test suite
